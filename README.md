# Advent of Code 2023

This year, I'm doing Advent of Code again - and attempting to use a different language every day. 
This is an attempt to recapture old knowledge about languages I've tried with and forgotten, and to familiarise myself with languages I've never looked at before.

Of course, for small solves, there are some solid constraints, which is good, because it makes the problem space smaller to explore and in turn, it easier to grok base principles of a given language.
As a beginner in most of those, I expect most solutions to be poorly-optimised and unidiomatic. 
The goal is to get working, running code. Not perfection. 

Anyways, Happy Christmas!
